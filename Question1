Assignment 1

Output of following program:-

Question 1 :-
1 . console.log(1+ “2” + “2”);
Ans -  “122”
Because second and third number is in double quotes so these numbers consider as string Hence output is 122

Question 2 :-
console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");
Ans - “32”
+ or - operand in front of a string converts string into number. so here +"2" will become 2 hence the result will be 32.

Question 3 :-
console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
Ans - 2
+ or - operand in front of a string converts string into number. so here -"1" will become -1 hence 
=1 + -"1" + "2"
=1+ - 1 + 2
=1- 1 + 2
= ”02”
So  the result will be 02.

Question 4 :-
console.log(+”1”+ "1" + "2");
Ans - “112”
+ or - operand in front of a string converts string into number. so here +"1" will become 1 hence the result will be 112.

Question 5 :-
console.log(“A” - "B" + "2");
Ans - “NaN2”
Addition of letters or characters will give us NaN result and 2 is consider as string “2”
Hence the result is NaN2 

Question 6 :-
console.log(“A” - "B" + 2);
Ans - NaN
Addition of letters or characters will give us NaN result and 2 is consider as number so addition of two different data types will give us NaN result hence the result will be NaN
